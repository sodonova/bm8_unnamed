##Hello!
This is an android app based in java, using the radar sdk.

It is for boilermake VIII.

##To teammates:
Open bm8_unnamed/MoogleGaps in android studio, not bm8_unnamed.

Under app/res/layout are the xml files which control the gui (like .ui).
Under app/java/tech/blindbool/mooglegaps/ is the java files which do things.
The gradle script build.gradle (Module: Moogle_Gapps.app) is like pip; it's wher
packages/libraries come in. You'll need to go there in android studio and click
sync now.

Make a file called radarkey in your base app directory and paste the published key in there.
